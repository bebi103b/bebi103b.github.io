    "1. It serves to review techniques of parameter estimation by optimization (in this case maximum likelihood estimation). We will use very similar techniques in a Bayesian context in the next couple of weeks.\n",
    "2. It provides and example and a watch-out for how fragile statistical modeling is. You will need to think about the structure of your model and investigate its failure modes. You can do this with techniques you learned last term, and we will spend a lot of time with Bayesian approaches to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** A common approach to parameter estimation is to find the so-called \"best-fit\" parameters and report them. \"Best fit\" is interpreted in a least squares sense and finding those parameters involves a least squares calculation in which the sum of the squares of the residuals is minimized. This approach is equivalent to performing a maximum likelihood estimate of a model in which the data are Normally distributed about the theoretical curve with a variance $\\sigma^2$ that is the same for all concentrations. Specifically,\n",

    "For each of the five genotypes get the \"best fit\" parameters $\\beta\\Delta E_\\mathrm{u}$, $K_\\mathrm{do}$, $K_\\mathrm{dc}$. You do not need to compute confidence intervals for these estimates in this part, though you may in the next parts of the problem. You may with to refer to [this lesson from last term](http://bebi103.caltech.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2019a/content/lessons/lesson_08/regression.html#Least-squares) for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** For each \"best fit\" parameter, plot the \"best fit curve\" along with the data. This is the theoretical curve parametrized by the parameters you found in part (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** In my experience, the vast majority of analyses stop after part (b). **TO GREAT PERIL!** This model/data combination is an example of a case where quantitative interpretation of the estimates you get for the parameters would lead to erroneous conclusions. I will tell you now that this model is not **identifiable** with these measurements. (Remember, when we say a model is not identifiable, it means that we cannot unambiguously determine the parameter values. That is, two or more parameter sets are observationally equivalent.) You job in this part of the problem is to demonstrate that the model is not identifiable."
