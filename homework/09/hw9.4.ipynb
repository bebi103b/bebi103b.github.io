    "In this problem, we will work with data from a [paper by Rasson and coworkers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.09.002). The authors were investigating the biochemistry of Spire-actin interactions. Spire is an actin binding protein that can nucleate actin filaments. In particular, it has four domains (called $S_A$, $S_B$, $S_C$, and $S_D$), which bind monomeric actin. These four domains, acting in concert, can line up actin monomers to help in nucleation. In this problem, we will determine the dissociation constant, $K_d$, describing binding of $S_D$ to monomeric actin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy to determine $K_d$ is to perform a titration experiment and then use nonlinear regression to determine $K_d$. Consider the chemical reaction describing $S_D$-actin binding.\n",

    "The problem with this approach is that we do not have a direct way of measuring $c_{ad}$.  The authors instead employed [fluorescence anisotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_anisotropy). I will not go into the details here of how it works, but will simply say that larger complexes rotate more slowly, and therefore give a higher fluorescence anisotropy signal (which is dimensionless) than do smaller complexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the authors fluorescently tagged $S_D$. We will call this molecule $S_{D^*}$, with concentration $c_{d^*}$. When free in solution, this molecule gives an anisotropy signal of $r_f$. When bound to actin, it gives an anisotropy signal of $r_b$. So, the total anisotropy signal we detect is\n",

    "\n",
    "This is all fine and good, but if we do this regression, we are measuring the dissociation constant of $S_{D^*}$, *not* $S_D$. To get $K_d$, we can use the fact that we know $K_d^*$ from dissociation experiments described above. Now, say we add monomeric actin, $S_{D^*}$, *and* $S_D$ to a reaction mixture.
