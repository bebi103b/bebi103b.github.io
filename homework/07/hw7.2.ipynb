    "We have thoroughly investigated the process by which microtubules undergo catastrophe using data from the [Gardner, Zanic, et al. paper](../protected/papers/gardner_2011.pdf). We used an Exponential, Gamma, Weibull, and our custom two-step distribution to model the catastrophe times. We have consistently found that the Gamma model works best. It does have the shortcoming,though, that it does not *directly* match a story that might arise from chemical kinetics, which we strongly suspect would regulate microtubule castastrophe. We expect an *integer* number $m$ of Poisson processes to arrive sequentially in order for catastrophe to occur. The Exponential and two-step model are special cases we have already considered where $m = 1$ and $m = 2$, respectively. In this problem, we will consider a model for arbitrary $m$ and assess which $m$ gives the most plausible generative model. We will again use the experiment run with a tubulin concentration of 12 ÂµM as our data set.\n",
