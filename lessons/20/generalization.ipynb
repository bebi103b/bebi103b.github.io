    "the work is all in coming up with the models for the likelihood $f(y\\mid \\theta)$, and prior, $g(\\theta \\mid \\phi)\\,g(\\phi)$, in the case of a two-level hierarchical model. For coming up with the conditional portion of the prior, $g(\\theta \\mid \\phi)$, we often assume a Gaussian distribution because this often describes experiment-to-experiment variability. (The Beta distribution we used in the worm reversal example is approximately Gaussian and has the convenient feature that it is defined on the interval $[0,1]$.) Bayes's theorem gives you the posterior, and it is then \"just\" a matter of computing it by sampling from it. In coming lessons, we will use Stan to sample out of hierarchical models and discuss the difficulties involved with doing that."
