    "As we start to do more involved statistical inference using Stan, you may want to run your calculations on more powerful machines. While a local installation on your own machine may suffice, it will serve you well to have more expansive computing resources available. There are many options for this, including [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), and Caltech's own [high performance computing center](http://www.hpc.caltech.edu/). In this lesson, we will show you how to get up and running with AWS. While it looks like a lot of steps, some of the steps are done only once, so it is not much more work to launch instances after the initial setup. The [next part of this lesson](aws_usage.ipynb) serves as a quick reference for how to spin up instances and use them after you have completed the setup outlined in this part of the lesson."

    "## 2. Launch your instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Log on to the AWS Console by going to [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and clicking on the button at the upper right of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are on the AWS Console page, you can launch your instance. We have set up an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which has the software you need for the course installed and the data sets pre-loaded. The AMI is available in **Oregon** (us-west-2). Be sure to select this region from the top right corner of the console. You should use the same region throughout the course, since that is physically where your machine will live.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To launch an instance with this AMI, choose EC2 among the services available from your AWS console. You can select EC2 from the `Services` pulldown menu at the top left of your screen. \n",
    "2. After selecting EC2, you will see a menu of options the left pane. Under `Images` there, click `AMIs`. \n",
    "3. The resulting menu will default to AMIs `Owned by me` (you likely do not have any). Select instead `Public images`. \n",
    "4. In the search menu, search for `bebi103`, and the class AMI should appear. If it does not, double check to make sure your region is Oregon.\n",
    "5. You will see the `bebi103` AMI listed. Right click on it and select `Launch instance from AMI`. (You may also select `Request Spot instance` if you want to save some money, but when you stop a spot instance, you will lose whatever you stored there.) \n",
    "6. You will then be taken to the `Launch an instance` page. In the `Name and tags` pane, you can give your instance a name, which I recommend, since it will help you find it more easily in your menu of instances when you come back to it. I simply named mine `bebi103`.\n",
    "7. You can skip the `Application and OS Images` pane because you already selected your AMI.\n",
    "8. In the `Instance type` pane, you are given many choices of instance types. For our beginning usage of Stan, I recommend a `c5.xlarge` instance, which as 4 cores and costs about 17Â¢/hour to use. When we start doing simulation based calibration (SBC), which is the most computationally intensive part of the course, I would use a `c5.2xlarge` instance or larger (8 or more cores).\n",
    "9. In the `Key pair (login)` pane, you will need to create a new key pair if you do not already have an AWS key pair. Click `Create new key pair` and in the pop-up window, you can enter a name for the key pair (something like `bebi103_aws_keypair` would be fine). Leave the default radio buttons selected and click `Create key pair`. Once you create the key pair, it will be downloaded to your local machine. **DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT store the key pair in any git repository, or anything that is backed up to the cloud, like Dropbox. ONLY store it locally on your machine and never, ever let it out to the internet.** You only need to create the key pair once; you can reuse it going forward.\n",
    "10. In the `Network settings` pane, you can select sources to allow SSH traffic. You can leave this as \"Anywhere\" and leave everything else as the defaults. If you are concerned about security, you can instead only allow SSH traffic from your IP address, but this may prove inconvenient if you want to access your instance from home and on campus.\n",
    "11. In the `Configure storage` pane, select 30 GiB gp2 root volume. This should be enough storage for installed software, data sets, MCMC samples, and the rest of your work.\n",
    "12. Click `Launch instance` at the bottom right of the right `Summary` pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following those steps, your instance will spin up. You can view your running instances by clicking on `Instances` on the dashboard on the left part of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will take a while for your instance to spin up. When the `Instance State` says `running` and the `Status Checks` are complete, your instance is ready for you."
