The cells had fluorescently tagged mechnosensitive ion channels. Based on fluorescence, they could determine the number $N$ of channels each cell had. They then exposed the cells to an osmotic shock and observed whether each cell exploded or survived the shock. So, for each cell they had a data pair, $(N, S)$, where $S$ is one if the cell survived and zero if it exploded. \n", "\n", "**a)** Develop a generative model for this system.\n", "\n", "**b)** "]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<br/>"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.11.5"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
