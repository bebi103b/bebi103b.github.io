He then exposed the cells to an osmotic shock and observed whether each cell exploded or survived the shock. So, for each cell he had a data pair, $(N, S)$, where $S$ is one if the cell survived and zero if it exploded. Develop a generative model for this system.\n", "\n", "There is a well-known class of models used to describe experiments like this.
