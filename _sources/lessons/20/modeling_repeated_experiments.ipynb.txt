    "In [Homework 4.2](../../homework/04/hw4.2.ipynb), we studied reversals under exposure to blue light in *C. elegans* with Channelrhodopsin in two different neurons. Let's consider one of the strains which contains a Channelrhodopsin in the ASH sensory neuron. We considered data done in three different years by the students of [Bi 1x](http://bi1x.caltech.edu). In 2015, we found that 9 out of 35 worms reversed under exposure to blue light. In 2016, 12 out of 35 reversed. In 2017, 18 out of 54 reversed."

The parameter we are trying to estimate, the probability of reversal $\\theta$, needs a prior. A Beta distribution makes sense for this, and we will choose a Beta distribution that weakly disfavors a zero or one probability of reversal.\n",

Actually, we could imagine doing the experiment over and over again, say $k$ times, each time getting a value of $n$ and $N$. Conditions may change from experiment to experiment. For example, we may have different lighting set-ups, slight differences in the strain of worms we're using, etc. We are left with some choices on how to model the data."

    "Each of these extremes have their advantages. We are often trying to estimate a parameter that is more universal than our experiments, e.g., something that describes worms with Channelrhodopsin in the ASH neuron generally. So, pooling the experiments makes sense. On the other hand, we have reason to assume that there is going to be a different value of $\\theta$ in different experiments, as biological systems are highly variable, not to mention measurement variations. So, how can we capture both of these effects?\n",

    "We can consider a model in which there is a \"global\" reversal probability, which we will call $\\phi$, and the values of $\\theta_i$ may vary from this $\\phi$ according to some probability distribution, $g(\\theta_i\\mid \\phi)$. So now, we have parameters $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_k$ and $\\phi$. So, the posterior can be written using Bayes's theorem, defining $\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots)$, $N = (N_1, N_2, \\ldots)$, and $n = (n_1, n_2, \\ldots)$,\n",
